This project contains .NET extension methods for .NET programmers that make some things a bit easier.  The original code was by Rob Conery.  His original Nuget package placed the code in App_Code directory which caused some trouble with certain project types.  I wanted it to work with all project types so I built his code into a .dll and packaged it.
